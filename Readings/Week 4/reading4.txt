Obviously the map.harvard.edu is easier because it only shows the actual university in detail.

For going from A to B I would use Google, since they show bus station, direction of the road and have an actual built-in method for finding the
shortest route.

For the purpose of visiting HU, I would say the one from harvard because of its simplicity.
For everyday use probably Google.

Objective: Showing the maximum temperature in america
Audience: Those interested in weather (??)

Good use of a rainbow colormap, the colors can easily be associated with hotter/colder. 
I wouldn't recommend any other color map.
