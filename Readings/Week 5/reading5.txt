1. if the 0.5 dimension is the distance from you to an object, a3d visualisation would be
useful when you can't rotate it? How is a 3d (visual-space) visualisation not a 2.5d 
dimension then?

3. Improves readability, efficiency, performance. Enables animated transitions.
Generally quicker to write.

4. 4g, the complexity doesn't interfere. but it doesn't serve its purpose (finding 
a package, but it isn't providing the names easily.)

5. The interactivity mostly adds a extra dimension for data. (time for example, or in case
of 4g it gives the info itself.) I would prefer 1c over 1a.
