Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.

- The == operator uses basic data conversion. By definition a empty string ("") or NaN are automatically 
converted to a False boolean, hence "" == False returns True. The === prevents this kind of data conversion
and hence "" === False returns False. 

- With closure you return a function within a function. This can prevent you from having to deal with 
a lot of variables. 

- High order functions simply take functions as input or return them as output, closures are examples of 
higher order functions

- A querySelector selects the first element it matches in CSS.
